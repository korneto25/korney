        <h1>Philippine Heroes</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Philippine heroes are the brave men and women who dedicated their lives to fight for our country’s freedom, dignity, and identity. Through courage, sacrifice, and love for the nation, they stood up against colonizers, injustice, and oppression. From national figures like Dr. José Rizal and Andrés Bonifacio to unsung heroes in every region, their stories remind us that patriotism comes in many forms — through words, actions, and even silent resistance. Their legacy continues to inspire generations of Filipinos to uphold the values of freedom, unity, and resilience.</p>
