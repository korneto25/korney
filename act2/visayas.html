                <p>The Visayas is the central region of the Philippines, known for its vibrant culture, historical landmarks, and world-class natural wonders. It is made up of several islands, including famous ones like Cebu, Bohol, Iloilo, Leyte, Negros, and Samar. This region is often called the “Heart of the Philippines” — not just because of its location, but because of its rich traditions, warm people, and breathtaking destinations.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Visayas region holds a rich and colorful history. It was in Cebu where Ferdinand Magellan first landed in 1521, marking the beginning of Spanish influence in the Philippines. The Battle of Mactan, led by the native chieftain Lapu-Lapu, was the first recorded act of resistance against foreign rule. The region also played a significant role during the Philippine Revolution and World War II, especially in Leyte, where General Douglas MacArthur made his famous landing in 1944.</p>

                <p>The Visayas is located in the central part of the Philippines and is composed of several islands grouped into three main regions: Western Visayas, Central Visayas, and Eastern Visayas. This region is surrounded by important bodies of water such as the Visayan Sea, Bohol Sea, and Samar Sea, which contribute to its rich marine biodiversity. The terrain is a mix of coastal plains, rolling hills, and mountain ranges, making it both agriculturally productive and visually stunning. Western Visayas includes provinces like Iloilo, Aklan, and Antique; Central Visayas includes Cebu, Bohol, and Negros Oriental; and Eastern Visayas consists of Leyte, Samar, and Biliran. The Visayas is also known for its white sand beaches, coral reefs, and numerous islands and islets, making it a top destination for eco-tourism and island hopping adventures.</p>
