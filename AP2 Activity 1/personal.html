            <p>My personal life has been a journey of self-discovery and growth. One of the most significant chapters was understanding and embracing my sexuality—a process that taught me the importance of self-acceptance and staying true to who I am.</p>
            <p>I’ve also found joy in the things that make life brighter. My love for mobile legends (ML) has been more than just a pastime; it’s a way to connect with friends, strategize, and unwind. And then there’s my deep affection for animals—dogs and cats, in particular, have a special place in my heart. Their companionship and unconditional love have brought endless happiness and comfort to my life.</p>
