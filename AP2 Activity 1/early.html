            <p>I was born in Lapu-Lapu, a city surrounded by the sea's calm embrace. My childhood was filled with moments of laughter, family traditions, and lessons that shaped my values. Whether it was helping my mother in the kitchen or listening to my grandfather's stories, those early years taught me the importance of kindness, patience, and hard work.</p>
            <p>In school, I enjoyed diving into subjects that sparked my curiosity. High school wasn't easy, I had a lot of trouble adjusting to the sorroundings, but thanks to the friends I made along my high school journey, they helped me adapt and prepare for the challenges ahead and taught me resilience.</p>
            <p>When I entered college, it felt like stepping into a new world. Deciding what course I had to take was one of the hardest choices I had to make. I didn't know what i really want but I ended up taking Bachelor in Science in Information Systems. I found myself a new circle of friends, and at the same time I am still discovering who I really am. College is a time of growth, filled with late nights studying, team projects, and moments of personal achievement that would not only make myself proud but also my parents.</p>
